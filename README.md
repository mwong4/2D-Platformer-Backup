This is a backup version of the TV game.

The TV Game is a 2D Platformer where you play as an old TV. The central goal is to get to the end of the level (situated on the far right of the map) while 
avoiding and combating obstacles and enemies. You can jump on platforms while trying not to fall to your death.
